## Datasets

Data splits are provided in `data/data_splits` folder.

### NYU Depth V2

Download the dataset from [here](https://github.com/zzangjinsun/NLSPN_ECCV20/tree/master). This is a preprocessed version of the original NYU Depth V2 dataset and does not have prerequisite data preparation steps.

### KITTI Depth

Download the dataset from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction). Follow instructions in [this repo](https://github.com/zzangjinsun/NLSPN_ECCV20/tree/master) to prepare the data. At this point, to use Eigen split one needs to download raw dataset as well from the [official website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php).
