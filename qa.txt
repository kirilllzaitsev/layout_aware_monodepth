what about extension to less structured envs
infuse structural knowledge from 2D lines and vanishing points on a calibrated camera to improve depth estimation
    what does it mean to infuse knowledge on a calibrated? camera?
    or as restated a bit farther
        Integrate vanishing point detections in the architecture for FURTHER AND MORE EXPLICIT 3D GUIDANCE in the calibrated camera case.
            what is 'case' in this case?
            what are other cases
