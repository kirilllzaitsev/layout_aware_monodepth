STRUCTURAL LAYOUT CUES OF AN INDOOR ENVIRONMENT (E.G. LINES AND VANISHING POINTS) INTO A TRANSFORMER MODEL TO AID MONOCULAR DEPTH ESTIMATION.

- hybrid convolutional and transformer architecture
    to allow the architecture to reason about and along structurally relevant lines, and their corresponding vanishing point which constraints the line's 3D inclination in a calibrated setting
- indoor environments
